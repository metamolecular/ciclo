# Ciclo: Exhaustive Cycle Enumeration

Exhaustive cycle enumeration is a common requirement when working with graphs. Many algorithms have been published. A particularly simple and efficient variant is described in [*A New Algorithm for Exhaustive Ring Perception in a Molecular Graph*](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci960322f). This crate implements that algorithm. For details, see [the article](https://depth-first.com/articles/2023/01/26/exhaustive-cycle-enumeration-in-rust/).
